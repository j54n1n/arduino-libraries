# arduino-libraries
Reusable generic libraries for Arduino projects. The libraries are prefixed with
the *asl* namespace (short for Arduino&nbsp;Standard&nbsp;Library) to avoid name
clashes with existing libraries.

This set of libraries require at least
[Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software) v1.6.8, where v1.8.1 or
newer is recommended.

## How to install
### Manual Installation
Click on the "Clone or download" button in the upper right corner. Exctract the
ZIP file, and *move and rename* the extracted folder either to the location
"**~/Documents/Arduino/libraries**" or to your custom *sketchbook* folder.
Create the "libraries" folder if it doesn't exist. Open Arduino IDE and a bunch
of new libraries should show up in the libraries menu.
